# Smart-Calculator

## üìù Project Overview
The **Smart Calculator** is a small JavaScript project that allows users to perform different types of calculations from a simple menu.  
It combines **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** to create an interactive calculator that shows results on the webpage, in the console, and through alerts.  

The goal of this project is to practice:
- User Defined Functions (UDFs)
- Loops and conditional statements
- Recursive functions
- DOM manipulation in JavaScript
